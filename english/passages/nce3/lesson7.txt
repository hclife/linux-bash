Mutilated ladies

Has it ever happened to you? Have you ever put your trousers in
the washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank
note in your back pocket? When you rescued your trousers, did
you find the note was whiter than white? People who live in
Britain needn't despair when they make mistakes like this (and
a lot of people do)! Fortunately for them, the Bank of England
has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from
people who fed their money to a machine or to their dog. Dogs,
it seems, love to chew up money!
A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiance, John, runs a
successful furniture business. John had a very good day and put
his wallet containing 3,000 pounds into the microwave oven for
safekeeping. Then he and Jane went horse-riding. When they got
home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without
realizing it, cooked her fiance's wallet as well. Imagine their
dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes
turned to ash! John went to see his bank manager who sent the
remains of wallet and the money to the special department of
the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilated Ladies! They
examined the remains and John got all his money back. "So long
as there's something to identify, we will give people their
money back," said a spokeswoman for the Bank. "Last year, we
paid 1.5m pounds on 21,000 claims."
